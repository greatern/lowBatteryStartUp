# Deliverable 1: Requirements and Analysis

## 1. Background to the Problem

### Industry/Company/Project Sponsor Background
The *Grocery Rescue App* is an innovative solution designed to address the growing issue of food waste and hunger in communities. The project is sponsored by a coalition of supermarkets, NGOs, and community organizations that recognize the need for a more efficient system to redistribute surplus food.

### Current System in Place
Currently, the process of food redistribution is fragmented. Supermarkets often have surplus food that goes to waste due to a lack of efficient distribution channels. NGOs and individuals in need rely on sporadic donations and food drives, which are not always reliable or sufficient.

## 2. Surveys/Interviews with Stakeholders

### Stakeholders
- *Supermarkets:* Concerned with reducing food waste, managing excess inventory, and gaining tax benefits through donations.
- *NGOs/Orphanages:* Focused on receiving consistent and reliable food donations to support their beneficiaries.
- *Individuals/Families in Need:* Require access to essential food resources and educational materials on food preservation and budgeting.
- *Volunteers:* Interested in contributing to the community by assisting in food distribution and transportation.

### Key Findings
- Supermarkets want a streamlined process for donating surplus food and tracking their contributions for tax and CSR purposes.
- NGOs need a reliable system to request and receive food donations, with limits to ensure fair distribution.

## 3. Problem Statement
The current system for food redistribution is inefficient, leading to significant food waste and unmet needs within communities. There is a lack of coordination between supermarkets, NGOs, and volunteers, resulting in missed opportunities to rescue surplus food and distribute it to those in need.

## 5. Feasibility Study

### Technical Feasibility
The app can be developed using existing technologies such as mobile app development frameworks (e.g., React Native, Flutter) and cloud-based services for real-time data synchronization.

### Economic Feasibility
The app has the potential to generate cost savings for supermarkets by reducing food waste and providing tax benefits.

### Operational Feasibility
The app can be integrated into the existing workflows of supermarkets, NGOs, and volunteers with minimal disruption.
